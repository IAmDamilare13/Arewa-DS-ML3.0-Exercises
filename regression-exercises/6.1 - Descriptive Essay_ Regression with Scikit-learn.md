## Descriptive Essay on Regression with Scikit-learn

To model the relationships in the Linnerud dataset with Scikit-learn, we first load the data using `load_linnerud()`, which gives us two sets of variables: exercise features (`chinups, situps, jumps`) and physiological targets (`weight, waist, pulse`). Since we want to explore the relationship between waistline (from the target variables) and situps (from the exercise variables), we extract these columns as `X` (situps) and `y` (waistline). We then create a linear regression model using `LinearRegression()` from `sklearn.linear_model`, fit it with our selected data, and use it to predict waist measurements for given situp counts. Finally, we visualize the relationship by plotting the actual datapoints as a scatter plot and overlaying the regression line. The same approach can be applied to other variable pairs in the dataset—for example, modeling `chinups` vs `weight`, `jumps` vs `pulse`, or any other combination of exercise and physiological measurements—by simply selecting the relevant feature as `X` and the desired target as `y`, then fitting and plotting the regression line for each pair. This process allows us to see how each type of exercise is statistically related to different physical attributes in the dataset.
